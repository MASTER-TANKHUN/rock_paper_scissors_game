# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Introduction
This is a simple and fun command-line Rock Paper Scissors game where you play against a bot. You can choose to play a best-of series with an odd number of rounds and try to outsmart the bot!

## How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Choose how many rounds you want to play (must be an odd number like 3, 5, 7, etc.).
3. Pick your move by entering the corresponding number:
   - `1` for ✌️ (Scissors)
   - `2` for 👊 (Rock)
   - `3` for 🖐️ (Paper)
4. The game will count down before revealing both choices.
5. After each round, the scores will be displayed.
6. The first player to win more than half of the rounds wins the series.

## Features
- Choose your own "best of" format.
- The bot randomly selects its move to keep the game fair.
- Scores are updated after each round.
- The game declares a winner once someone secures the majority of wins.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Uses built-in `random` and `time` modules (no extra installation required)

## Additional Notes
- If you enter an even number for the "best of" rounds, the program will ask you to pick an odd number.
- If you enter an invalid move, the game will give you a warning and end the round.
- The bot’s choices are completely random, so each match is unpredictable!

Have fun and good luck! 🎮
